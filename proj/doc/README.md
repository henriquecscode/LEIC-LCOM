# ABOUT THE DEMONSTRATION VIDEO
We took a chance at making a more well produced video than the ones we found online - on _YouTube_ and other _Git_ repositories -, as we found that most of them were unpleasantly basic.

We managed to produce the video, and it is _very_ big in size, so we couldn't upload it here on _Git_. We did the next best thing and uploaded it both on _YouTube_ and _Google Drive_.

## Watching the video on YouTube
We strongly advise the viewer to have some patience and watch the video in the highest quality _YouTube_ provides or the highest quality their Internet connection allows.

Here's the unlisted video's link:

## Download the video to watch it locally
We rendered/produced two different versions of the video, this because we figured that not every computer will respond well to the most recent video encoding codecs and formats.

If one is interested in downloading the video, we provide two options:

For the most recent codec, they can download the x265 version, which has a higher compression rate. Because of this, one must be confident their computer can handle it!

For a stronger chance of the video being playable on most computers, they can download the x264 version.

The difference in size shouldn't produce any noticeable differences in audio or video quality.

Here's the _Google Drive_ folder with both video versions - one must be using their _@g.uporto.pt_ account to be able to access it:
